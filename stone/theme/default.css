/**
 * This file defines the default theme for using in docx/xlsx/pptx
 *
 * The OpenXML Specification defines the hierarchical tree of a theme:
 *   - theme
 *     - themeElements
 *       - clrScheme
 *       - fontScheme
 *       - fmtScheme
 *         - fillStyleLst
 *         - lnStyleLst
 *         - effectStyleLst
 *         - bgFillStyleLst
 *     - objectDefaults
 *     - extraClrSchemeLst
 *     - extLst
 *       - thm15:themeFamily
 *
 * By convention, from the perspective of the favored CSS engine, the root element of a theme is the name of dialect of Scribble,
 *   without prefix `scribble/`, that is to say, you could make your theme varying from scribble/base to scribble/manual to others.
 *
 * NOTE that, the reason why we employ CSS as the styling language is that
 *   the syntax of XML is a piece of shit, however the OpenXML employed by MS Office is even more cumbersome,
 *   as such, the logic structure of the favored CSS engine is just as distinct as it should be.
 *
 * A boolean value is represented as CSS integer, and interpreted as in C language.
 *
 * A color can be one of CSS colors, OpenXML colors, and OpenXML color transforms.
 *   * CSS colors are preferable;
 *   * The OpenXML scheme colors are representated as CSS keywords; 
 *   * Other supported OpenXML colors are represented as functions, whose names are exactly what they've been defined in OpenXML References,
 *   *   like `sysClr`;
 *   * The OpenXMl color tranformations are represented as the function `clrTransform(color, tranforms ...)`, where
 *       `transforms` are also representated as functions: alpha, red, green, blue, hue, sat, lum.  
 *
 *   The CSS keyword `currentcolor` is equivalent to the OpenXML keyword `phClr`
 *   The OpenXML keywords are case sensitive, and so are their corresponding CSS keywords
 *
 * A fill style can be one of CSS images, OpenXML fills.
 *   * CSS images are preferable;
 *   * The `grpFill` and `noFill` are represented by CSS keywords `group` and `none`, respectively;
 *   * The `solidFill` is just any value of colors;
 *   * The `gradFill` is represented by some flattened functions similar to CSS gradient notations;
 *   * Any unimplemented fills are reinterpreted as `noFill`
